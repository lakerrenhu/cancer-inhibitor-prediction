# cancer-inhibitor-prediction
The main purpose in this project is to develop reliable prediction model that be able to predict whether a given molecule is a CDK2 inhibitor. In this project a bunch of machine learning methods are applied to learn the prediction model of cancer inhibitor. These methods include elastic net, support vector classifier (SVC), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Huber Regressor (HR), Lasso, Lasso plus cross-validation (Lasso CV), least-angle regression (LAR), Bayesian Ridge (BR), stochastic gradient descent classifier (SGDC), Ridge regres-sion (RR), Logistic Regression (LR), Orthogonal Match Pursuit (OMP), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Qlattice, convolutional neural network (CNN). The performance metrics of the models are developed on test dataset, represented by precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy, and ROC.
